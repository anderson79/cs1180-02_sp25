## Install Instructions (The Easy Option)
You have a few options when it comes to programming in Java. The recommended way is to install an Integrated Developement Environment (IDE) that will set-up everything you need. IntelliJ Community Edition is a free Java IDE, and it is what I will use for in-class coding examples.

#### IntelliJ
1. Navigate to [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) to download IntelliJ.
2. If you are not using Windows, click the corresponding tab for your Operating System. Scroll down to IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is paid software.)
3. Click download. Note: make sure you are clicking download for the Community Edition.
4. Once the file has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installer.
5. Follow all prompts.
   * On the "Installation Options" menu, make sure to select ".java" under "Create Associations".
   * Additionally, select "Add "bin" folder to the PATH" under "Update PATH Variables".
   * You can also select "Add "Open Folder as Project"" under "Update Context Menu".
6. Allow IntelliJ to restart your computer.
7. IntelliJ is installed!

### Install Instructions (Less Easy Way)
There are many different IDEs available and each programmer finds one they like best. There is no required IDE for this class, so feel free to use any IDE you are familiar with (provided it supports Java). Below are installation instructions for two different IDEs. NOTE: You only need to install **ONE** of these IDEs, not both.

I (your instructor) will be using IntelliJ in class as I prefer its features for Java over VSCode.

The TAs are generally most familiar with VSCode, so if you do run into IDE issues, there is more help available for VSCode.

Over the course of your education, it is a good idea to become familiar with both, as they each serve their own purpose in the workforce. VSCode is often favored for being light-weight and more customizable. However, IntelliJ (and other more fully-fledged IDEs) often work better for large-scale projects and offer a plethora of built-in functionality especially since IntelliJ is designed specifically for Java. Proficient programmers should be able to program in any standard IDE

|**IntelliJ**|**VSCode**|
|:---:|:---:|
| Java specific | Supports many languages |
| More resource intensive | More lightweight |
| Git integration | Git integration |
| Easier start-up | More customization |

### Java Install
VS Code is not an IDE, but an extendiable text-editor that provides coding functionality. Unlike Intellij, VS Code does not come with a way to run Java programs, so you must install the Java Development Kit (JDK) seperately.

1. Navigate to [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows) to download Java. Oracle is the company behind Java.
2. The link will automatically take you to the Windows download page. If you use Linux or macOS, click the corresponding tabs.
3. If you are using Windows, select either the .exe or .msi installer. All of the installers contain the same thing, it is just the method of install that differs.
4. Once the file has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installer.
5. Follow all prompts.
6. Java is installed!

#### VSCode (MacOS)
1. Navigate to [visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Click the MacOS *universal* download button
3. Once the file has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installer.
4. Drag the VSCode Icon into your applications folder
5. Launch VSCode
   * Select "Open" if MacOS asks "Are you sure you want to open this app downloaded from the internet?"

#### VSCode (Windows)
1. Navigate to [visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Click the Windows download button
3. Once the file has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installer.
4. Select "Yes" when it asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" 
4. Follow all prompts.
   - Next from the welcome screen
   - Select "I accept" to the license agreement
   - Leave the destination folder as the default, and click "Next"
   - Click "Install"
5. Launch VSCode
